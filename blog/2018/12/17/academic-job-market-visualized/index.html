        <p>I am <em>so beyond thrilled</em> to announce that I&rsquo;ll be joining the <a href="https://aysps.gsu.edu/">Andrew Young School of Policy Studies</a> at <a href="https://www.gsu.edu/">Georgia State University</a> in Fall 2019 as an assistant professor in the <a href="https://aysps.gsu.edu/public-management-policy/">Department of Public Management and Policy</a>. I&rsquo;ll be teaching classes in statistics/data science, economics, and nonprofit management in beautiful downtown Atlanta, and we&rsquo;ll be moving back to the South. I am so so excited about this! The Andrew Young School does amazing work in public policy, administration, and nonprofit management, and I&rsquo;ll be working with phenomenal colleagues and students. I still can&rsquo;t believe this is real.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I&rsquo;m in shock is that for the past 2.5 years, I&rsquo;ve been ripped apart and destroyed by the academic job market. This job market is a horrendous beast of a thing. It is soul-crushing and dream-shattering and a constant stream of rejection. While facing rejection <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/opinion/sunday/writers-rejections-resolutions.html">is good and builds grit etc., etc.</a>, in reality it&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>In an effort to stay On Brand™, here are a bunch of fancy graphs and numbers showing what it&rsquo;s been like to apply for nearly 200 jobs since August 2016. Unlike many of my other blog posts, I haven&rsquo;t included any of the code to generate these. <a href="https://github.com/andrewheiss/academic-job-market/blob/master/README.Rmd">That code</a> is all available in a <a href="https://github.com/andrewheiss/academic-job-market">GitHub repository</a> (see <code>README.Rmd</code>), along with the <a href="https://github.com/andrewheiss/academic-job-market/blob/master/data/jobs_clean.csv">raw data</a> that I&rsquo;ve collected over the past few years (for the morbidly curious).</p>
<h2 id="application-count-and-outcomes">Application count and outcomes</h2>
<p>Between August 31, 2016 and November 18, 2018, I applied for 186 tenure-track and non-tenure-track academic jobs at R1 schools, liberal arts colleges, and teaching-focused public universities. I was offered one two-year visiting assistant professorship at the <a href="https://marriottschool.byu.edu/mpa/">Romney Institute of Public Service and Ethics</a> at BYU (where I completed my MPA before getting my PhD), and one tenure-track assistant professorship at the Andrew Young School at Georgia State University.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s a 98.9% rejection rate. Here&rsquo;s what the weight of rejection looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/12/17/academic-job-market-visualized/index_files/figure-html/plot-waffle-total-1.png" width="2100" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Not every one of these was an outright rejection. The typical academic search goes through a few stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Screen hundreds of initial applications</li>
<li>Skype or call 10-15 possible candidates</li>
<li>Fly out ≈3 candidates</li>
<li>Extend offer to 1 candidate</li>
</ol>
<p>I made it through different stages of this process with many of the schools I applied to. In total, I had 27 Skype interviews and 9 flyouts over three years. This waffle plot divides up each of the applications by their final outcome (i.e. Skype, flyout, offer), discipline, and year. smh polisci.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/12/17/academic-job-market-visualized/index_files/figure-html/iron-waffles-1.png" width="2100" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>I received my PhD in public policy, with an emphasis in political science and international relations. Many faculty at Duke emphasized that having a dual emphasis like this would be great for the academic job market—because I&rsquo;m trained in both fields, I could theoretically fit comfortably in a traditional political science department or in a public policy or administration department/school. I applied to positions in both disciplines, but I was <em>far</em> less successful in getting any traction in the political science world (even though I attend and present research at ISA and APSA pretty regularly and <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/research/heiss-kelley-2017/">I have published in the Journal of Politics</a> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).</p>
<p>My first year on the market, I was split 50/50 between public administration/policy jobs and political science jobs. During my second year, because I had very little response from political science I focused almost entirely on public admin/policy. During this most recent cycle, out of desperation I went back to applying to political science jobs in international relations and comparative politics. In the chart below, my proportion of public admin/policy jobs is actually the lowest this year, but that&rsquo;s because (1) political science deadlines are way earlier, and (2) I essentially quit applying for jobs. This stopping was both because <a href="https://www.heissatopia.com/2018/11/thursday-night-and-grandmas-passing.html">my mom died suddenly</a>, which completely threw me off the rhythm of the market (i.e. I stopped applying completely until one school graciously e-mailed me to remind me to apply), and because I got an amazing job offer. I was on track for another 50/50 year, though.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/12/17/academic-job-market-visualized/index_files/figure-html/discipline-props-1.png" width="2100" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<h2 id="application-timing">Application timing</h2>
<p>Applying for jobs is also a grueling process. Here&rsquo;s what a typical job needs for a complete application:</p>
<ul>
<li>CV</li>
<li>Cover letter tailored for the job, department, and university</li>
<li>Teaching statement and/or research statement and/or diversity statement (and for a few religious schools I applied to, a belief statement)</li>
<li>Teaching evaluations and/or sample syllabuses</li>
<li>Transcripts from graduate school</li>
<li>Writing sample(s)</li>
<li>3–5 letters of recommendation</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, once I wrote a version of each of these things, applying to individual schools didn&rsquo;t take too terribly long. I spent August–September 2016 crafting my teaching/research/diversity statements and general cover letter, polishing my writing samples, and collecting letters of recommendation, and I edited and improved them over the whole 2.5-year process.</p>
<p>Writing cover letters generally took ≈45 minutes per school to scour each department&rsquo;s website for relevant programs, centers, faculty, and classes. On some of the days where I sent out 5+ applications, I occasionally forgot to change the recipient address in the cover letter, or writing “I am applying for job X at university Y” while leaving “University Z” from the previous application. This was always horrifying, but I got Skype interviews out of a couple of those, so I think search committees tend to be forgiving about those kinds of mistakes.</p>
<p>This plot shows my pace of applying for jobs. Each dot is a job; each column is a week. The fall semester has been the most intense for sending out applications. In 2016–17, my record was 16 jobs in one week; in 2017–18 it was only 6 (since I severely cut back on political science jobs); and in 2018–19, I applied for 30 jobs in one week. With a rough average of 1 hour per application, <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewheiss/status/1046608912617680896">that week was particularly intense</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/12/17/academic-job-market-visualized/index_files/figure-html/dotplot-faux-facet-1.png" width="1800" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>So many dots.</p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Finally, another unique aspect of the academic job market is the fact that you rarely have control over where you end up. If you want to live in a specific state or city, you have to make sure a university there has an open position in your exact field (and then you have to compete against 300+ other applicants, so lolz to that). Friends, family, and neighbors would always suggest that I send my CV to nearby schools because &ldquo;surely they&rsquo;ll find a place for you—you&rsquo;re smart!&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s not how academia works.</p>
<p>I applied to positions in 12 different countries, with most in the United States.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/12/17/academic-job-market-visualized/index_files/figure-html/countries-bar-1.png" width="2100" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a world map showing the locations of all these jobs across the three years. It&rsquo;s really hard to see any patterns beyond the fact that I only applied for jobs in the Gulf in 2016–17, I guess?</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/12/17/academic-job-market-visualized/index_files/figure-html/countries-map-cycle-1.png" width="2100" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Since the bulk of my applications went to schools in the US and Canada, here&rsquo;s a more zoomed-in map. Because there are occasionally clusters of schools—particularly along the east coast—I put a 15-mile radius around each school, and if any of those buffer zones overlapped, I increased the point size to show how many schools are in that shared area. <a href="https://github.com/andrewheiss/academic-job-market/blob/master/README.Rmd#L441">The code for this is actually pretty magical and ingenius</a>—it&rsquo;s worth it to <a href="https://github.com/andrewheiss/academic-job-market/blob/master/README.Rmd#L441">check out the R code</a> for this post just for those calculations :).</p>
<p>I applied to schools in 36 states + DC. I didn&rsquo;t apply to any schools in Alaska, Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wyoming.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/12/17/academic-job-market-visualized/index_files/figure-html/map-blobs-1.png" width="2400" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
